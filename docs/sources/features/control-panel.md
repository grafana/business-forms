You can use the Business Forms panel to create control panels with multiple sections that share the same identifier.

## Additional features

- Read-only form elements can display labels for the current state by using lookup options, similar to radio buttons and select boxes.
- Update requests can pass only the updated values in the request payload.
- You can request confirmation of updated values before an update request runs.
