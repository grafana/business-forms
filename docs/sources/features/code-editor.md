# Code Editor Toolbar

{{< admonition type="note" >}}

The Business Forms panel supports the Code Editor toolbar starting from version 4.4.0. Additional buttons were added in 4.5.0.

## Expand the editor

For a better user experience, we added the expand the editor area button.

You can find this button at the top left corner of any JavaScript area parameter.
